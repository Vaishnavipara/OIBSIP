# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Overview:
In this project, we focus on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The experience provided hands-on exposure to real-world machine learning applications in fraud prevention.

# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
Overview:
This project involves training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their measurements. The dataset provides a basis for understanding supervised learning techniques.

# Unemployment Analysis with Python
Overview:
This project analyzes unemployment trends using a dataset that spans from May 2019 to June 2020. The analysis provides insights into unemployment rates and labor participation.

# Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to build an email spam detector using machine learning. By training a model to classify emails into spam and non-spam (ham), we can combat the issues associated with spam emails.

# Sales Prediction with Machine Learning
Overview
Sales prediction is crucial for product-based businesses looking to forecast future revenue and optimize advertising spending. In this project, we apply machine learning to understand how different advertising channels impact sales and develop a predictive model using Linear Regression.
